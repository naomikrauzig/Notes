The ocean heat content can be calculated in Matlab using the following steps:

Obtain the necessary temperature data: This can be obtained from in-situ measurements or from a model simulation. The data should be in the form of a 3D matrix, with the dimensions representing longitude, latitude, and depth.

Interpolate the data to a common grid: If the data is on different grids, it should be interpolated to a common grid to make the calculation of the heat content easier.

Define the vertical levels of interest: For example, if the heat content is being calculated between the surface and 300m depth, the vertical levels of interest should be defined as the surface and 300m.

Calculate the heat content: The heat content can be calculated using the formula:

heat_content = trapz(depth, trapz(latitude, trapz(longitude, temperature)));

where depth, latitude, and longitude are the vertical, latitudinal, and longitudinal grids, respectively, and temperature is the 3D temperature matrix. The trapz function in Matlab calculates the integral using the trapezoidal rule.

Repeat the calculation for different time steps: If the heat content is being calculated for different time steps, the above steps should be repeated for each time step to obtain the temporal evolution of the heat content.
